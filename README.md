# Reinforcement-Learning-Book

I have created a small book summarizing concepts from the Reinforcement Learning 2015 course at UCL (https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/).

My future ideas for this book are the following:

- Add content from more recent version of the course, published on Google DeepMind's resources page

- Add interesting chapters about state-of-the-art and important research papers to the book (e.g. successor functions, AlphaGo, ...)

- Provide code to the chapters that can help explain the content

- Fix styling and formatting / spelling and grammer where needed

However, these are just ideas at the moment. Feel free to contact me for collaboration if this idea sounds interesting to you and you want to help me progressing further.
